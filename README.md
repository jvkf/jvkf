### hey, i'm joÃ£o, but you can call me by jota or jay ðŸ‘‹

i'm a fullstack developer with 3 years of experience using **typescript**. my primary focus is around **react** and its frameworks like next, tanstack, vite or astro. When building backend APIs, I enjoy working with any **node** framework. I'm familiar with both SQL and NoSQL DBs, like **postgres**, **mongo** and **redis**. Lately I've been working with **terraform** to provision IaC on GCP. right now I'm working @ Dynamox, an industry company located at FlorianÃ³polis.
