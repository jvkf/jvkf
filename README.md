### hey, i'm joÃ£o, but you can call me by jota or jay ðŸ‘‹

i'm a fullstack developer with 3 years of experience using **javascript/typescript**. my primary focus is around **react** and its frameworks like next, vite and astro. When building RESTful APIs, I use with **node** alongside frameworks like **express**. I'm familiar with both SQL and NoSQL DBs, like **postgres**, **mongo** and **redis**. Lately I've been working with **terraform** to implement IaC. right now I'm working @ Dynamox, an industry/tech company located at FlorianÃ³polis / SC.
